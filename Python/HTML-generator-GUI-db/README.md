# HTML Generator GUI
***
### Objective

I was asked to create a GUI using Python 3 with tkinter and sqlite3. This GUI needed to allow the user to edit the body of an html page, save multiple versions in a database, and also allow them to publish a chosen version.

### Process

This assignment was given to me in stages. First, I created a GUI that automatically generated a hard coded html page on command. Then I changed it to allow the user to set the content for the body of the page. Finally, I made it possible to save multiple versions of the body text in a sqlite database and to export a chosen version to the html file.

### Result

I enjoyed working on this. It's a very satisfying culmination to what I learned in the Python course. I was called on to create a GUI that responds to user input, connects with a database, and can create and open a file on the push of a button. Having met the assignment parameters I'm now looking forward to making a few improvements, but I'm really pleased with the results so far.
